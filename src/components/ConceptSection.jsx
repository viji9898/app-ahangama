        for tourists, surfers and long-stay residents.

        <h3>Why this site</h3>
        <ul className="ap-list">
          <li>20 m from the surf and beach across Galle–Matara Road.</li>
          <li>Road frontage on three sides (main road + Mahavihara Road).</li>
          <li>
            Surrounded by existing cafés and guesthouses – dense hospitality
            cluster.
          </li>
          <li>
            Natural demand for coffee, convenience, wellness and quality
            apartments.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Vision</h3>
        <p>
          To create a small but high-performing corner of Ahangama that feels
          like a lived-in village: shaded, intimate, textured and walkable, with
          everyday uses stacked efficiently on a tight urban site.
